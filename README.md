## Background

Welcome to the Belly Button Biodiversity Challenge! This project delves into the fascinating world of the microbes that inhabit human belly buttons. Our dataset reveals that while a few microbial species, known as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), are found in more than 70% of people, many others are less common.

## Interactive Dashboard
This project features an interactive dashboard that enables users to:

+ **View Demographic Information:**
  + Select a test subject ID for their demographic details.
+ **Explore Top 10 Bacterial Cultures:**
    + Analyze the top 10 bacterial cultures found in the selected test subject.
+ **Examine Bacteria Abundance:**
    + View the number of bacterial cultures per sample.
    
Explore the interactive dashboard at [Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard](file:///Users/anigevorgyan/Downloads/Challenge%2014/index.html) to analyze the dataset directly from your local environment.

## Tools Used
+ **JavaScript:** Powers the app's behavior and dynamically updates the HTML, including demographics data, dropdown menu options, and graph attributes.
+ **Plotly:** Used for rendering the bubble chart and bar graphs.
+ **D3:** Extracts data from the dataset URL and dynamically renders it within the dashboard, including setting up event listeners for updating data based on dropdown selections.
+ **HTML:** Structures the webpage content and layout, which is dynamically updated by JavaScript.
