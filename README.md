# Background
Welcome to the Belly Button Biodiversity Challenge! This project explores the fascinating world of the microbes that inhabit human belly buttons. Our dataset reveals that while a few microbial species (operational taxonomic units or OTUs) are common among more than 70% of people, many others are relatively rare. 

This project provides an interactive dashboard that allows users to select a test subject ID to view their demographic information, the top 10 bacterial cultures present, and the abundance of bacteria cultures per sample.

Explore the interactive dashboard at Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard to analyze the dataset directly from your local environment.
