## Background

Welcome to the Belly Button Biodiversity Challenge! 
This project explores the microbial ecosystems living in human navelsâ€”a unique and mostly unexplored part of our bodies. The goal is to catalog and understand the different microorganisms, called operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The dataset shows that while a few OTUs are found in more than 70% of people, most OTUs are relatively rare.

## Interactive Dashboard
This project features an interactive dashboard that enables users to:

+ **View Demographic Information:**
  + Select a test subject ID for their demographic details.
+ **Explore Top 10 Bacterial Cultures:**
    + Analyze the top 10 bacterial cultures found in the selected test subject.
+ **Examine Bacteria Abundance:**
    + View the number of bacterial cultures per sample.

## Tools Used
+ **JavaScript:** Powers the app's behavior and dynamically updates the HTML, including demographics data, dropdown menu options, and graph attributes.
+ **Plotly:** Used for rendering the bubble chart and bar graphs.
+ **D3:** Extracts data from the dataset URL and dynamically renders it within the dashboard, including setting up event listeners for updating data based on dropdown selections.
+ **HTML:** Structures the webpage content and layout, which is dynamically updated by JavaScript.
